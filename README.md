## Project 1: Classification of Elite and Sub Elite Goalkeepers in professional men’s football using multiple machine learning algorithms (https://github.com/Ash1708/Classification-of-Goalkeepers_ML)

### This is the Machine Learning project I did during my Internship


* Data was taken from several elite European leagues over five seasons (2013/2014–2017/2018) obtained from Opta Sports.
* Used Random undersampling to deal with class imbalance.
* Algorithms used:  Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost using scikit-learn
* Evaluation:  Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
* Documented methodologies, generated visualizations, and provided actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making.





## Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis of football player data_EA Sports

### This was a part of my personnal project to explore EDA

* Visualizations, summary statistics, Identifying and imputing missing data and checked for data quality problems.
* Comparisons of various stats between players of similar playing positions.




## Project 3: A study on Javelin throw anaylsis using Inertial Measurement Units

* Visualizations of Acceleration over time for various athletes.
* Reliability and validation of Inertial Measurement system. (With force plates, motion capture systems (Vicon), and Optogait)
* Parameters analyzed : Stance duration, Step times, Stride Length, Stride time.
