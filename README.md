## Project 1: Classification of Elite and Sub Elite Goalkeepers in professional men’s football using multiple machine learning algorithms (https://github.com/Ash1708/Classification-of-Goalkeepers_ML)

### This is the Machine Learning project I did during my Internship to classify goalkeepers based on their level of expertise using Machine learning Algorithms.


* Data was taken from several elite European leagues over five seasons (2013/2014–2017/2018) obtained from Opta Sports.
* Used Random undersampling to deal with class imbalance.
* Algorithms used:  Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost using scikit-learn
* Evaluation:  Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
* Documented methodologies, generated visualizations, and provided actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making.


## Project 2: Vertical Play - Evaluating Market value of elite midfielders based on their ability to play vertical pass (https://github.com/Ash1708/Vertical-Play_Market-value-evaluation-of-soccer-players)

Research Question : To evaluate the vertical passing abilities of elite midfield soccer players using the metrics verticality and depth and investigate the correlation with market value.
Data Collection   : The dataset for this study included Opta event data from 282 matches of the top French soccer league (Ligue 1) in season 2020/21, which provides the match sheet and detailed contextual information at the time of each event.

Result             : The current study demonstrates that true midfielders and offensive midfielders exhibit a positive correlation between market value and the two metrics, verticality and depth. Further                         analysis indicates that this correlation is particularly strong for players over 24 years old. for wing midfielders, there is a positive correlation between age and market value. This can                     be attributed to the age distribution of different types of midfielders.


## Project 3: Exploratory Data Analysis of football player data_EA Sports (https://github.com/Ash1708/Exploratory-Data-Analysis_Football_Players/tree/main)

### This was a part of my personnal project to explore EDA

* Visualizations, summary statistics, Identifying and imputing missing data and checked for data quality problems.
* Comparisons of various stats between players of similar playing positions.




## Project 4: A study on Javelin throw anaylsis using Inertial Measurement Units: Application Development (https://github.com/Ash1708/IMU_sensor_data/tree/main)

### In this project, I have analysed the technical parameters of Javelin throw and plotte the EDA and checked the reliability of the IMU system, further developed into an application.

* Visualizations of Acceleration over time for various athletes.
* Reliability and validation of Inertial Measurement system. (With force plates, motion capture systems (Vicon), and Optogait)
* Parameters analyzed : Stance duration, Step times, Stride Length, Stride time.


## Project 5: Effects of Constrained small sided games on physical & technical variables on University football Players (https://github.com/Ash1708/Soccer_Player_Analysis_GPS)

#### Research Question : Does the manipulation of constraints in football SSG has any effect on physical & technical performances of University football players.

* Data Collection : Wimu PRO GPS devices
* Constraints : a. Game mute condition (Players can not communicate verbally among themselves)
                b. Game rectangle condition : In the middle of the pitch there is a rectangle dimensioned 3mx2m.
                c. Normal with no constraints.
