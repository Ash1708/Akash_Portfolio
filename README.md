## Project 1: Classification of Elite and Sub Elite Goalkeepers in professional men’s football using multiple machine learning algorithms (https://github.com/Ash1708/Classification-of-Goalkeepers_ML)

### This is the Machine Learning project I did during my Internship to classify goalkeepers based on their level of expertise using Machine learning Algorithms.


* Data was taken from several elite European leagues over five seasons (2013/2014–2017/2018) obtained from Opta Sports.
* Used Random undersampling to deal with class imbalance.
* Algorithms used:  Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost using scikit-learn
* Evaluation:  Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
* Documented methodologies, generated visualizations, and provided actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making.





## Project 2: Exploratory Data Analysis of football player data_EA Sports (https://github.com/Ash1708/Exploratory-Data-Analysis_Football_Players/tree/main)

### This was a part of my personnal project to explore EDA

* Visualizations, summary statistics, Identifying and imputing missing data and checked for data quality problems.
* Comparisons of various stats between players of similar playing positions.




## Project 3: A study on Javelin throw anaylsis using Inertial Measurement Units: Application Development (https://github.com/Ash1708/IMU_sensor_data/tree/main)

### In this project, I have analysed the technical parameters of Javelin throw and plotte the EDA and checked the reliability of the IMU system, further developed into an application.

* Visualizations of Acceleration over time for various athletes.
* Reliability and validation of Inertial Measurement system. (With force plates, motion capture systems (Vicon), and Optogait)
* Parameters analyzed : Stance duration, Step times, Stride Length, Stride time.


## Project 4: Effects of Constrained small sided games on physical & technical variables on University football Players (https://github.com/Ash1708/Soccer_Player_Analysis_GPS)

#### Research Question : Does the manipulation of constraints in football SSG has any effect on physical & technical performances of University football players.

* Data Collection : Wimu PRO GPS devices
* Constraints : a. Game mute condition (Players can not communicate verbally among themselves)
                b. Game rectangle condition : In the middle of the pitch there is a rectangle dimensioned 3mx2m.
                c. Normal with no constraints.
